  abstract = {ABSTRACT A major goal of speciation research is identifying loci that underpin barriers to gene flow. Population genomics takes a ‘bottom-up’ approach, scanning the genome for molecular signatures of processes that drive or maintain divergence. However, interpreting the ‘genomic landscape’ of speciation is complicated, because genome scans conflate multiple processes, most of which are not informative about gene flow. However, studying replicated population contrasts, including multiple incidences of secondary contact, can strengthen inferences. In this paper, we use linked-read sequencing (haplotagging), FST scans and genealogical methods to characterise the genomic landscape associated with replicate hybrid zone formation. We studied two flower colour varieties of the common snapdragon, Antirrhinum majus subspecies majus, that form secondary hybrid zones in multiple independent valleys in the Pyrenees. Consistent with past work, we found very low differentiation at one well-studied zone (Planoles). However, at a second zone (Avellanet), we found stronger differentiation and greater heterogeneity, which we argue is due to differences in the amount of introgression following secondary contact. Topology weighting of genealogical trees identified loci where haplotype diversity was associated with the two snapdragon varieties. Two of the strongest associations were at previously identified flower colour loci: Flavia, that affects yellow pigmentation, and Rosea/Eluta, two linked loci that affect magenta pigmentation. Preliminary analysis of coalescence times provides additional evidence for selective sweeps at these loci and barriers to gene flow. Our study highlights the impact of demographic history on the differentiation landscape, emphasising the need to distinguish between historical divergence and recent introgression.},

  abstract = {Reproductive isolation (RI) is a core concept in evolutionary biology. It has been the central focus of speciation research since the modern synthesis and is the basis by which biological species are defined. Despite this, the term is used in seemingly different ways, and attempts to quantify RI have used very different approaches. After showing that the field lacks a clear definition of the term, we attempt to clarify key issues, including what RI is, how it can be quantified in principle, and how it can be measured in practice. Following other definitions with a genetic focus, we propose that RI is a quantitative measure of the effect that genetic differences between populations have on gene flow. Specifically, RI compares the flow of neutral alleles in the presence of these genetic differences to the flow without any such differences. RI is thus greater than zero when genetic differences between populations reduce the flow of neutral alleles between populations. We show how RI can be quantified in a range of scenarios. A key conclusion is that RI depends strongly on circumstances—including the spatial, temporal and genomic context—making it difficult to compare across systems. After reviewing methods for estimating RI from data, we conclude that it is difficult to measure in practice. We discuss our findings in light of the goals of speciation research and encourage the use of methods for estimating RI that integrate organismal and genetic approaches.AbstractReproductive isolation (RI) is a core concept in evolutionary biology and the basis by which biological species are defined.

So then, what limits the range of a species? There are physical constraints and also population genetic limits to the effectiveness of selection, ultimately set by population size. Global adaptation, where the same genotype is favoured over the whole range, is most efficient when based on a multitude of weakly selected alleles and is effective even when local demes are small, provided that there is some gene flow. In contrast, local adaptation is sensitive to gene flow and may require alleles with substantial effect. How can populations combine the advantages of large effective size with the ability to specialise into local niches? To what extent does reproductive isolation help resolve this tension? I address these questions using eco-evolutionary models of polygenic adaptation, contrasting discrete demes with continuousspace.},

  abstract = { Local adaptation leads to differences between populations within a species. In many systems, similar environmental contrasts occur repeatedly, sometimes driving parallel phenotypic evolution. Understanding the genomic basis of local adaptation and parallel evolution is a major goal of evolutionary genomics. It is now known that by preventing the break-up of favourable combinations of alleles across multiple loci, genetic architectures that reduce recombination, like chromosomal inversions, can make an important contribution to local adaptation. However, little is known about whether inversions also contribute disproportionately to parallel evolution. Our aim here is to highlight this knowledge gap, to showcase existing studies, and to illustrate the differences between genomic architectures with and without inversions using simple models. We predict that by generating stronger effective selection, inversions can sometimes speed up the parallel adaptive process or enable parallel adaptation where it would be impossible otherwise, but this is highly dependent on the spatial setting. We highlight that further empirical work is needed, in particular to cover a broader taxonomic range and to understand the relative importance of inversions compared to genomic regions without inversions.

@article{barton2023infinitesimal,
  abstract = {{The classical infinitesimal model is a simple and robust model for the inheritance of quantitative traits. In this model, a quantitative trait is expressed as the sum of a genetic and an environmental component, and the genetic component of offspring traits within a family follows a normal distribution around the average of the parents’ trait values, and has a variance that is independent of the parental traits. In previous work, we showed that when trait values are determined by the sum of a large number of additive Mendelian factors, each of small effect, one can justify the infinitesimal model as a limit of Mendelian inheritance. In this paper, we show that this result extends to include dominance. We define the model in terms of classical quantities of quantitative genetics, before justifying it as a limit of Mendelian inheritance as the number, M, of underlying loci tends to infinity. As in the additive case, the multivariate normal distribution of trait values across the pedigree can be expressed in terms of variance components in an ancestral population and probabilities of identity by descent determined by the pedigree. Now, with just first-order dominance effects, we require two-, three-, and four-way identities. We also show that, even if we condition on parental trait values, the “shared” and “residual” components of trait values within each family will be asymptotically normally distributed as the number of loci tends to infinity, with an error of order 1/M. We illustrate our results with some numerical examples.}},

  abstract = {{Evolutionary biologists have an array of powerful theoretical techniques that can accurately predict changes in the genetic composition of populations. Changes in gene frequencies and genetic associations between loci can be tracked as they respond to a wide variety of evolutionary forces. However, it is often less clear how to decompose these various forces into components that accurately reflect the underlying biology. Here, we present several issues that arise in the definition and interpretation of selection and selection coefficients, focusing on insights gained through the examination of selection coefficients in multilocus notation. Using this notation, we discuss how its flexibility—which allows different biological units to be identified as targets of selection—is reflected in the interpretation of the coefficients that the notation generates. In many situations, it can be difficult to agree on whether loci can be considered to be under “direct” versus “indirect” selection, or to quantify this selection. We present arguments for what the terms direct and indirect selection might best encompass, considering a range of issues, from viability and sexual selection to kin selection. We show how multilocus notation can discriminate between direct and indirect selection, and describe when it can do so.}},

  abstract = {{We study the evolution of inversions that capture locally adapted alleles when two populations are exchanging migrants or hybridizing. By suppressing recombination between the loci, a new inversion can spread. Neither drift nor coadaptation between the alleles (epistasis) is needed, so this local adaptation mechanism may apply to a broader range of genetic and demographic situations than alternative hypotheses that have been widely discussed. The mechanism can explain many features observed in inversion systems. It will drive an inversion to high frequency if there is no countervailing force, which could explain fixed differences observed between populations and species. An inversion can be stabilized at an intermediate frequency if it also happens to capture one or more deleterious recessive mutations, which could explain polymorphisms that are common in some species. This polymorphism can cycle in frequency with the changing selective advantage of the locally favored alleles. The mechanism can establish underdominant inversions that decrease heterokaryotype fitness by several percent if the cause of fitness loss is structural, while if the cause is genic there is no limit to the strength of underdominance that can result. The mechanism is expected to cause loci responsible for adaptive species-specific differences to map to inversions, as seen in recent QTL studies. We discuss data that support the hypothesis, review other mechanisms for inversion evolution, and suggest possible tests.}},

In this study, we take a novel approach by studying how population structure affects both pairwise identity and the distribution of heterozygosity in a natural population of the self-incompatible plant Antirrhinum majus. Excess variance in heterozygosity between individuals is due to identity disequilibrium, which reflects the variance in inbreeding between individuals; it is measured by the statistic g2. We calculated g2 together with FST and pairwise relatedness (Fij) using 91 SNPs in 22,353 individuals collected over 11 years. We find that pairwise Fij declines rapidly over short spatial scales, and the excess variance in heterozygosity between individuals reflects significant variation in inbreeding. Additionally, we detect an excess of individuals with around half the average heterozygosity, indicating either selfing or matings between close relatives. We use 2 types of simulation to ask whether variation in heterozygosity is consistent with fine-scale spatial population structure. First, by simulating offspring using parents drawn from a range of spatial scales, we show that the known pollen dispersal kernel explains g2. Second, we simulate a 1,000-generation pedigree using the known dispersal and spatial distribution and find that the resulting g2 is consistent with that observed from the field data. In contrast, a simulated population with uniform density underestimates g2, indicating that heterogeneous density promotes identity disequilibrium. Our study shows that heterogeneous density and leptokurtic dispersal can together explain the distribution of heterozygosity.}},

  abstract = {The coalescent process can describe the effects of selection at linked loci only if selection is so strong that genotype frequencies evolve deterministically. Here, we develop methods proposed by Kaplan, Darden, and Hudson to find the effects of weak selection. We show that the overall effect is given by an extension to Price's equation: the change in properties such as moments of coalescence times is equal to the covariance between those properties and the fitness of the sample of genes. The distribution of coalescence times differs substantially between allelic classes, even in the absence of selection. However, the average coalescence time between randomly chosen genes is insensitive to the current allele frequency and is affected significantly by purifying selection only if deleterious mutations are common and selection is strong (i.e., the product of population size and selection coefficient, Ns>3). Balancing selection increases mean coalescence times, but the effect becomes large only when mutation rates between allelic classes are low and when selection is extremely strong. Our analysis supports previous simulations that show that selection has surprisingly little effect on genealogies. Moreover, small fluctuations in allele frequency due to random drift can greatly reduce any such effects. This will make it difficult to detect the action of selection from neutral variation alone.},

  abstract = {Maladapted individuals can only colonise a new habitat if they can evolve a positive growth rate fast enough to avoid extinction, a process known as evolutionary rescue. We treat log fitness at low density in the new habitat as a single polygenic trait and use the infinitesimal model to follow the evolution of the growth rate; this assumes that the trait values of offspring of a sexual union are normally distributed around the mean of the parents' trait values, with variance that depends only on the parents' relatedness. The probability that a single migrant can establish depends on just two parameters: the mean and genetic variance of the trait in the source population. The chance of success becomes small if migrants come from a population with mean growth rate in the new habitat more than a few standard deviations below zero; this chance depends roughly equally on the probability that the initial founder is unusually fit, and on the subsequent increase in growth rate of its offspring as a result of selection. The loss of genetic variation during the founding event is substantial, but highly variable. With continued migration at rate M, establishment is inevitable; when migration is rare, the expected time to establishment decreases inversely with M. However, above a threshold migration rate, the population may be trapped in a 'sink' state, in which adaptation is held back by gene flow; above this threshold, the expected time to establishment increases exponentially with M. This threshold behaviour is captured by a deterministic approximation, which assumes a Gaussian distribution of the trait in the founder population with mean and variance evolving deterministically. By assuming a constant genetic variance, we also develop a diffusion approximation for the joint distribution of population size and trait mean, which extends to include stabilising selection and density regulation. Divergence of the population from its ancestors causes partial reproductive isolation, which we measure through the reproductive value of migrants into the newly established population.},

  abstract = {When polygenic traits are under stabilizing selection, many different combinations of alleles allow close adaptation to the
optimum. If alleles have equal effects, all combinations that result in the same deviation from the optimum are equivalent.
Furthermore, the genetic variance that is maintained by mutation–selection balance is 2m= S per locus, where m is the mutation rate
and S the strength of stabilizing selection. In reality, alleles vary in their effects, making the fitness landscape asymmetric and
complicating analysis of the equilibria. We show that that the resulting genetic variance depends on the fraction of alleles near
fixation, which contribute by 2m= S , and on the total mutational effects of alleles that are at intermediate frequency. The interplay
p ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi
between stabilizing selection and mutation leads to a sharp transition: alleles with effects smaller than a threshold value of 2 m= S
remain polymorphic, whereas those with larger effects are fixed. The genetic load in equilibrium is less than for traits of equal effects,
and the fitness equilibria are more similar. We find that
p ffiffiffiffiffiffi if the optimum is displaced, alleles with effects close to the threshold value
sweep first, and their rate of increase is bounded by m S : Long-term response leads in general to well-adapted traits, unlike the case
of equal effects that often end up at a suboptimal fitness peak. However, the particular peaks to which the populations converge are
extremely sensitive to the initial states and to the speed of the shift of the optimum trait value.},

@article{barton2008statistical,
  abstract = {The evolution of quantitative characters depends on the frequencies of the alleles involved, yet these
frequencies cannot usually be measured. Previous groups have proposed an approximation to the
dynamics of quantitative traits, based on an analogy with statistical mechanics. We present a modified
version of that approach, which makes the analogy more precise and applies quite generally to describe
the evolution of allele frequencies. We calculate explicitly how the macroscopic quantities (i.e., quantities
that depend on the quantitative trait) depend on evolutionary forces, in a way that is independent of the
microscopic details. We first show that the stationary distribution of allele frequencies under drift,
selection, and mutation maximizes a certain measure of entropy, subject to constraints on the expectation
of observable quantities. We then approximate the dynamical changes in these expectations, assuming
that the distribution of allele frequencies always maximizes entropy, conditional on the expected values.
When applied to directional selection on an additive trait, this gives a very good approximation to the
evolution of the trait mean and the genetic variance, when the number of mutations per generation is
sufficiently high (4Nm . 1). We show how the method can be modified for small mutation rates (4Nm /
0). We outline how this method describes epistatic interactions as, for example, with stabilizing selection.},

@article{slatkin1989comparison,
  abstract = {Three methods for estimating the average level of gene flow in natural population are discussed and compared. The three methods are FST, rare alleles, and maximum likelihood. All three methods yield estimates of the combination of parameters (the number of migrants [Nm] in a demic model or the neighborhood size [4πDσ2] in a continuum model) that determines the relative importance of gene flow and genetic drift. We review the theory underlying these methods and derive new analytic results for the expectation of FST in stepping-stone and continuum models when small sets of samples are taken. We also compare the effectiveness of the different methods using a variety of simulated data. We found that the FST and rare-alleles methods yield comparable estimates under a wide variety of conditions when the population being sampled is demographically stable. They are roughly equally sensitive to selection and to variation in population structure, and they approach their equilibrium values at approximately the same rate. We found that two different maximum-likelihood methods tend to yield biased estimates when relatively small numbers of locations are sampled but more accurate estimates when larger numbers are sampled. Our conclusion is that, although FST and rare-alleles methods are expected to be equally effective in analyzing ideal data, practical problems in estimating the frequencies of rare alleles in electrophoretic studies suggest that FST is likely to be more useful under realistic conditions.},

@article{sella2019thinking,
  abstract = { Many traits of interest are highly heritable and genetically complex, meaning that much of the variation they exhibit arises from differences at numerous loci in the genome. Complex traits and their evolution have been studied for more than a century, but only in the last decade have genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in humans begun to reveal their genetic basis. Here, we bring these threads of research together to ask how findings from GWASs can further our understanding of the processes that give rise to heritable variation in complex traits and of the genetic basis of complex trait evolution in response to changing selection pressures (i.e., of polygenic adaptation). Conversely, we ask how evolutionary thinking helps us to interpret findings from GWASs and informs related efforts of practical importance.

Using both spatially continuous and stepping-stone models, we show that the distribution of pedigree ancestors approaches a travelling wave, for which we develop two alternative approximations. The speed and width of the wave are sensitive to the local details of the model. After a short time, genetic ancestors spread far more slowly than pedigree ancestors, ultimately diffusing out with radius rather than spreading at constant speed. In contrast to the wave of pedigree ancestors, the spread of genetic ancestry is insensitive to the local details of the models.},

@article{lohse2016efficient,
  abstract = {The inference of demographic history from genome data is hindered by a lack of efficient computational approaches. In particular, it has proved difficult to exploit the information contained in the distribution of genealogies across the genome. We have previously shown that the generating function (GF) of genealogies can be used to analytically compute likelihoods of demographic models from configurations of mutations in short sequence blocks (Lohse et al. 2011). Although the GF has a simple, recursive form, the size of such likelihood calculations explodes quickly with the number of individuals and applications of this framework have so far been mainly limited to small samples (pairs and triplets) for which the GF can be written by hand. Here we investigate several strategies for exploiting the inherent symmetries of the coalescent. In particular, we show that the GF of genealogies can be decomposed into a set of equivalence classes that allows likelihood calculations from nontrivial samples. Using this strategy, we automated blockwise likelihood calculations for a general set of demographic scenarios in Mathematica. These histories may involve population size changes, continuous migration, discrete divergence, and admixture between multiple populations. To give a concrete example, we calculate the likelihood for a model of isolation with migration (IM), assuming two diploid samples without phase and outgroup information. We demonstrate the new inference scheme with an analysis of two individual butterfly genomes from the sister species Heliconius melpomene rosina and H. cydno.},

@article{ringbauer2018estimating,
  abstract = {In continuous populations with local migration, nearby pairs of individuals have on average more similar genotypes than geographically well-separated pairs. A barrier to gene flow distorts this classical pattern of isolation by distance. Genetic similarity is decreased for sample pairs on different sides of the barrier and increased for pairs on the same side near the barrier. Here, we introduce an inference scheme that uses this signal to detect and estimate the strength of a linear barrier to gene flow in two dimensions. We use a diffusion approximation to model the effects of a barrier on the geographic spread of ancestry backward in time. This approach allows us to calculate the chance of recent coalescence and probability of identity by descent. We introduce an inference scheme that fits these theoretical results to the geographic covariance structure of bialleleic genetic markers. It can estimate the strength of the barrier as well as several demographic parameters. We investigate the power of our inference scheme to detect barriers by applying it to a wide range of simulated data. We also showcase an example application to an Antirrhinum majus (snapdragon) flower-color hybrid zone, where we do not detect any signal of a strong genome-wide barrier to gene flow.},

@article{barton1990pleiotropic,
  abstract = {It is widely held that each gene typically affects many characters, and that each character is affected by many genes. Moreover, strong stabilizing selection cannot act on an indefinitely large number of independent traits. This makes it likely that heritable variation in any one trait is maintained as a side effect of polymorphisms which have nothing to do with selection on that trait. This paper examines the idea that variation is maintained as the pleiotropic side effect of either deleterious mutation, or balancing selection. If mutation is responsible, it must produce alleles which are only mildly deleterious (s approximately 10(-3)), but nevertheless have significant effects on the trait. Balancing selection can readily maintain high heritabilities; however, selection must be spread over many weakly selected polymorphisms if large responses to artificial selection are to be possible. In both classes of pleiotropic model, extreme phenotypes are less fit, giving the appearance of stabilizing selection on the trait. However, it is shown that this effect is weak (of the same order as the selection on each gene): the strong stabilizing selection which is often observed is likely to be caused by correlations with a limited number of directly selected traits. Possible experiments for distinguishing the alternatives are discussed.},

@article{barton1989divergence,
  abstract = {Polygenic variation can be maintained by a balance between mutation and stabilizing selection. When the alleles responsible for variation are rare, many classes of equilibria may be stable. The rate at which drift causes shifts between equilibria is investigated by integrating the gene frequency distribution W2N II (pq)4N mu-1. This integral can be found exactly, by numerical integration, or can be approximated by assuming that the full distribution of allele frequencies is approximately Gaussian. These methods are checked against simulations. Over a wide range of population sizes, drift will keep the population near an equilibrium which minimizes the genetic variance and the deviation from the selective optimum. Shifts between equilibria in this class occur at an appreciable rate if the product of population size and selection on each locus is small (Ns alpha 2 less than 10). The Gaussian approximation is accurate even when the underlying distribution is strongly skewed. Reproductive isolation evolves as populations shift to new combinations of alleles: however, this process is slow, approaching the neutral rate (approximately mu) in small populations.},

@article{barton2017infinitesimal,
  abstract = {Our focus here is on the infinitesimal model. In this model, one or several quantitative traits are described as the sum of a genetic and a non-genetic component, the first being distributed within families as a normal random variable centred at the average of the parental genetic components, and with a variance independent of the parental traits. Thus, the variance that segregates within families is not perturbed by selection, and can be predicted from the variance components. This does not necessarily imply that the trait distribution across the whole population should be Gaussian, and indeed selection or population structure may have a substantial effect on the overall trait distribution. One of our main aims is to identify some general conditions on the allelic effects for the infinitesimal model to be accurate. We first review the long history of the infinitesimal model in quantitative genetics. Then we formulate the model at the phenotypic level in terms of individual trait values and relationships between individuals, but including different evolutionary processes: genetic drift, recombination, selection, mutation, population structure, …. We give a range of examples of its application to evolutionary questions related to stabilising selection, assortative mating, effective population size and response to selection, habitat preference and speciation. We provide a mathematical justification of the model as the limit as the number M of underlying loci tends to infinity of a model with Mendelian inheritance, mutation and environmental noise, when the genetic component of the trait is purely additive. We also show how the model generalises to include epistatic effects. We prove in particular that, within each family, the genetic components of the individual trait values in the current generation are indeed normally distributed with a variance independent of ancestral traits, up to an error of order 1∕M. Simulations suggest that in some cases the convergence may be as fast as 1∕M.},

With a convex trade-off, a sexual population evolves a single generalist genotype, whereas with a concave trade-off, disruptive selection favours maximal variance.

With a concave trade-off, the population shifts sharply between a unimodal distribution with high gene flow and a bimodal distribution with strong isolation, as the underlying genetic variance increases. However, these alternative states are only simultaneously stable for a narrow parameter range. A sharp threshold is only seen if survival in the {\textquoteleft}wrong{\textquoteright} niche is low; otherwise, strong isolation is impossible. Gene flow from divergent demes makes speciation much easier in parapatry than in sympatry. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Royal Society},

@article{barton1986maintenance,
  abstract = {The maintenance of polygenic variation through a balance between mutation and stabilizing selection can be approximated in two ways. In the ‘Gaussian’ approximation, a normal distribution of allelic effects is assumed at each locus. In the ‘House of Cards’ approximation, the effect of new mutations is assumed to be large compared with the spread of the existing distribution. These approximations were developed to describe models where alleles may have a continuous range of effects. However, previous analyses of models with only two alleles have predicted an equilibrium variance equal to that given by the ‘House of Cards’ approximation. These analyses of biallelic models have assumed that, at equilibrium, the population mean is at the optimum. Here, it is shown that many stable equilibria may coexist, each giving a slight deviation from the optimum. Though the variance is given by the ‘House of Cards’ approximation when the mean is at the optimum, it increases towards a value of the same order as that given by the ‘Gaussian’ approximation when the mean deviates from the optimum. Thus, the equilibrium variance cannot be predicted by any simple model, but depends on the previous history of the population.},

@article{charlesworth1996recombination,
  abstract = {Experiments on Drosophila suggest that genetic recombination may result in lowered fitness of progeny (a 'recombination load'). This has been interpreted as evidence either for a direct effect of recombination on fitness, or for the maintenance of linkage disequilibria by epistatic selection. Here we show that such a recombination load is to be expected even if selection favours increased genetic recombination. This is because of the fact that, although a modifier may suffer an immediate loss of fitness if it increases recombination, it eventually becomes associated with a higher additive genetic variance in fitness, which allows a faster response to direction selection. This argument applies to mutation-selection balance with synergistic epistasis, directional selection on quantitative traits, and ectopic exchange among transposable elements. Further experiments are needed to determine whether the selection against recombination due to the immediate load is outweighed by the increased additive variance in fitness produced by recombination.},

  abstract = {Recently it has become feasible to detect long blocks of nearly identical sequence shared between pairs of genomes. These identity-by-descent (IBD) blocks are direct traces of recent coalescence events and, as such, contain ample signal to infer recent demography. Here, we examine sharing of such blocks in two-dimensional populations with local migration. Using a diffusion approximation to trace genetic ancestry, we derive analytical formulas for patterns of isolation by distance of IBD blocks, which can also incorporate recent population density changes. We introduce an inference scheme that uses a composite-likelihood approach to fit these formulas. We then extensively evaluate our theory and inference method on a range of scenarios using simulated data. We first validate the diffusion approximation by showing that the theoretical results closely match the simulated block-sharing patterns. We then demonstrate that our inference scheme can accurately and robustly infer dispersal rate and effective density, as well as bounds on recent dynamics of population density. To demonstrate an application, we use our estimation scheme to explore the fit of a diffusion model to Eastern European samples in the Population Reference Sample data set. We show that ancestry diffusing with a rate of [Formula: see text] during the last centuries, combined with accelerating population growth, can explain the observed exponential decay of block sharing with increasing pairwise sample distance.},

@article{paixao2016effect,
  abstract = {The role of gene interactions in the evolutionary process has long been controversial. Although some argue that they are not of importance, because most variation is additive, others claim that their effect in the long term can be substantial. Here, we focus on the long-term effects of genetic interactions under directional selection assuming no mutation or dominance, and that epistasis is symmetrical overall. We ask by how much the mean of a complex trait can be increased by selection and analyze two extreme regimes, in which either drift or selection dominate the dynamics of allele frequencies. In both scenarios, epistatic interactions affect the long-term response to selection by modulating the additive genetic variance. When drift dominates, we extend Robertson’s [Robertson A (1960) Proc R Soc Lond B Biol Sci 153(951):234−249] argument to show that, for any form of epistasis, the total response of a haploid population is proportional to the initial total genotypic variance. In contrast, the total response of a diploid population is increased by epistasis, for a given initial genotypic variance. When selection dominates, we show that the total selection response can only be increased by epistasis when some initially deleterious alleles become favored as the genetic background changes. We find a simple approximation for this effect and show that, in this regime, it is the structure of the genotype−phenotype map that matters and not the variance components of the population.},

  abstract = {Author Summary Evolution has produced a remarkable diversity of living forms that manifests in qualitative differences as well as quantitative traits. An essential factor that underlies this variability is transcription factor binding sites, short pieces of DNA that control gene expression levels. Nevertheless, we lack a thorough theoretical understanding of the evolutionary times required for the appearance and disappearance of these sites. By combining a biophysically realistic model for how cells read out information in transcription factor binding sites with model for DNA sequence evolution, we explore these timescales and ask what factors crucially affect them. We find that the emergence of binding sites from a random sequence is generically slow under point and insertion/deletion mutational mechanisms. Strong selection, sufficient genomic sequence in which the sites can evolve, the existence of partially decayed old binding sites in the sequence, as well as certain biophysical mechanisms such as cooperativity, can accelerate the binding site gain times and make them consistent with the timescales suggested by comparative analyses of genomic data.},

@article{turelli1994genetic,
  abstract = {We develop a general population genetic framework for analyzing selection on many loci, and apply it to strong truncation and disruptive selection on an additive polygenic trait. We first present statistical methods for analyzing the infinitesimal model, in which offspring breeding values are normally distributed around the mean of the parents, with fixed variance. These show that the usual assumption of a Gaussian distribution of breeding values in the population gives remarkably accurate predictions for the mean and the variance, even when disruptive selection generates substantial deviations from normality. We then set out a general genetic analysis of selection and recombination. The population is represented by multilocus cumulants describing the distribution of haploid genotypes, and selection is described by the relation between mean fitness and these cumulants. We provide exact recursions in terms of generating functions for the effects of selection on non-central moments. The effects of recombination are simply calculated as a weighted sum over all the permutations produced by meiosis. Finally, the new cumulants that describe the next generation are computed from the non-central moments. Although this scheme is applied here in detail only to selection on an additive trait, it is quite general. For arbitrary epistasis and linkage, we describe a consistent infinitesimal limit in which the short-term selection response is dominated by infinitesimal allele frequency changes and linkage disequilibria. Numerical multilocus results show that the standard Gaussian approximation gives accurate predictions for the dynamics of the mean and genetic variance in this limit. Even with intense truncation selection, linkage disequilibria of order three and higher never cause much deviation from normality. Thus, the empirical deviations frequently found between predicted and observed responses to artificial selection are not caused by linkage-disequilibrium-induced departures from normality. Disruptive selection can generate substantial four-way disequilibria, and hence kurtosis; but even then, the Gaussian assumption predicts the variance accurately. In contrast to the apparent simplicity of the infinitesimal limit, data suggest that changes in genetic variance after 10 or more generations of selection are likely to be dominated by allele frequency dynamics that depend on genetic details.},

@incollection{barton1993genetic,
  abstract = {When two distinct gene pools meet and produce fertile hybrids, the outcome varies
from gene to gene. At some loci a universally favorable allele has been established on
one side. Such alleles soon spread through the whole population and hence differences
are rarely observed. At other loci different alleles may be favored in different environments
or genetic backgrounds; selection maintains these differences in the face of random
mixing. At other loci—perhaps at most of those we observe in molecular surveys—different
alleles may have been established by chance and may have no
appreciable effect on fitness. These differences gradually fade away, at a rate that
depends on the strength of selection against introgression at the other loci with which
they are associated.
The frequencies of the various genotypes found in a hybrid zone tell us about the
overall strength of the selection, the number of genes involved, the rate of individual
dispersal, and the ease with which alleles cross from one gene pool into the other. The
aim of this chapter is to explain how data on discrete markers and on quantitative traits
can be used to estimate such parameters. We illustrate the methods using examples
from some of the hybrid zones that are discussed in more detail elsewhere in this book
and use computer simulations to show that the estimates do not depend on exactly
how selection maintains the differences between the hybridizing populations. Previous
reviews have considered the wider questions of what hybrid zones can tell us about
species and speciation and what role they themselves might play (Barton and Hewitt,
1985, 1 989; Hewitt, 1988; Harrison and Rand, 1989; see also Ch. I ). We concentrate
instead on the practical issues involved in the genetic analysis of hybrid zones. },

@article{barton2000effect,
  abstract = {Within hybrid zones that are maintained by a balance between selection and dispersal, linkage disequilibrium is generated by the mixing of divergent populations. This linkage disequilibrium causes selection on each locus to act on all other loci, thereby steepening clines, and generating a barrier to gene flow. Diffusion models predict simple relations between the strength of linkage disequilibrium and the dispersal rate, sigma, and between the barrier to gene flow, B, and the reduction in mean fitness, W. The aim of this paper is to test the accuracy of these predictions by comparison with an exact deterministic model of unlinked loci (r = 0.5). Disruptive selection acts on the proportion of alleles from the parental populations (p,q): W = exp[-S(4pq)beta], such that the least fit genotype has fitness e-s. Where beta < 1, fitness is reduced for a wide range of intermediate genotypes; where beta > 1, fitness is only reduced for those genotypes close to p = 0.5. Even with strong epistasis, linkage disequilibria are close to sigma 2p'ip'j/rij, where p'i, p'j are the gradients in allele frequency at loci i, j. The barrier to gene flow, which is reflected in the steepening of neutral clines, is given by [formula: see text] where r, the harmonic mean recombination rate between the neural and selected loci, is here 0.5. This is a close approximation for weak selection, but underestimates B for strong selection. The barrier is stronger for small beta, because hybrid fitness is then reduced over a wider range of p. The widths of the selected clines are harder to predict: though simple approximations are accurate for beta = 1, they become inaccurate for extreme beta because, then, fitness changes sharply with p. Estimates of gene number, made from neutral clines on the assumption that selection acts against heterozygotes, are accurate for weak selection when beta = 1; however, for strong selection, gene number is overestimated. For beta > 1, gene number is systematically overestimated and, conversely, when beta < 1, it is underestimated.},

This calculation applies in the limit where transitions are rare. Our results indicate that stochastic divergence is feasible despite free gene flow, provided that neighbourhood size is low enough. In two dimensions, the rate of transition depends primarily on neighbourhood size N and only weakly on selection pressure (≈sk exp(− cN)), where k is a number determined by the local population structure, in contrast with the exponential dependence on selection pressure in one dimension (≈exp(− cN √s)) or in a single deme (≈exp(− cNs)).

  abstract = {There has recently been considerable debate over the relative importance of selection against hybrids ("endogenous" selection) vs. adaptation to different environments ("exogenous") in maintaining stable hybrid zones and hence in speciation. Single-locus models of endogenous and exogenous viability selection generate clines of similar shape, but the comparison has not been extended to multilocus systems, which are both quantitatively and qualitatively very different from the single-locus case. Here we develop an analytical multilocus model of differential adaptation across an environmental transition and compare it to previous heterozygote disadvantage models. We show that the shape of clines generated by exogenous selection is indistinguishable from that generated by endogenous selection. A stochastic simulation model is used to test the robustness of the analytical description to the effects of drift and strong selection, and confirms the prediction that pairwise linkage disequilibria are predominantly generated by migration. However, although analytical predictions for the width of clines maintained by heterozygote disadvantage fit well with the simulation results, those for environmental adaptation are consistently too narrow; reasons for the discrepancy are discussed. There is a smooth transition between a system in which a set of loci effectively act independently of each other and one in which they act as a single nonrecombining unit.},

  abstract = {Random genetic drift shifts clines in space, alters their width, and distorts their shape. Such random fluctuations complicate inferences from cline width and position. Notably, the effect of genetic drift on the expected shape of the cline is opposite to the naive (but quite common) misinterpretation of classic results on the expected cline. While random drift on average broadens the overall cline in expected allele frequency, it narrows the width of any particular cline. The opposing effects arise because locally, drift drives alleles to fixation--but fluctuations in position widen the expected cline. The effect of genetic drift can be predicted from standardized variance in allele frequencies, averaged across the habitat: . A cline maintained by spatially varying selection (step change) is expected to be narrower by a factor of √1- relative to the cline in the absence of drift. The expected cline is broader by the inverse of this factor. In a tension zone maintained by underdominance, the expected cline width is narrower by about 1- relative to the width in the absence of drift. Individual clines can differ substantially from the expectation, and we give quantitative predictions for the variance in cline position and width. The predictions apply to clines in almost one-dimensional circumstances such as hybrid zones in rivers, deep valleys, or along a coast line and give a guide to what patterns to expect in two dimensions.},

  abstract = {The grasshopper Podisma pedestris includes two chromosomal races, which differ by a Robertsonian fusion involving the sex chromosome. The two races meet in a cline which runs for 100 km across the Alpes Maritimes in south-eastern France. An intensive study of the easternmost end of this cline shows that it is about 800 m wide; the cline is not smooth, containing substantial spikes in chromosome frequency which might be due to sampling drift. Though the cline seems narrow, it is wide compared with the dispersal rate of the insect; a selective force of only 0.5\% would be enough to maintain the cline. It is difficult to determine the nature of this force, but some evidence comes from the position of the cline, and from the presence of coincident clines at other loci. An estimate of the distribution of Podisma has been made, and the cline seems to follow, for the most part, a region of low population density, suggesting that it is maintained by hybrid unfitness. However, in the one region where the cline is relatively free to move, the XY race bulges forwards more than would be expected if hybrids are unfit. The observation of severe inviability in crosses between the races, though it is not associated with the chromosomal difference, also indicates that this cline is the result of some sort of genetic incompatibility.},

@article{lohse2011general,
  abstract = {Analysis of genomic data requires an efficient way to calculate likelihoods across very large numbers of loci. We describe a general method for finding the distribution of genealogies: we allow migration between demes, splitting of demes [as in the isolation-with-migration (IM) model], and recombination between linked loci. These processes are described by a set of linear recursions for the generating function of branch lengths. Under the infinite-sites model, the probability of any configuration of mutations can be found by differentiating this generating function. Such calculations are feasible for small numbers of sampled genomes: as an example, we show how the generating function can be derived explicitly for three genes under the two-deme IM model. This derivation is done automatically, using Mathematica. Given data from a large number of unlinked and nonrecombining blocks of sequence, these results can be used to find maximum-likelihood estimates of model parameters by tabulating the probabilities of all relevant mutational configurations and then multiplying across loci. The feasibility of the method is demonstrated by applying it to simulated data and to a data set previously analyzed by Wang and Hey (2010) consisting of 26,141 loci sampled from Drosophila simulans and D. melanogaster. Our results suggest that such likelihood calculations are scalable to genomic data as long as the numbers of sampled individuals and mutations per sequence block are small.},

We review the effects of such structuring on neutral variants, using a framework based on the coalescent process. Short-term effects of sex differences and age structure can be averaged out using fast timescale approximations, allowing a simple general treatment of effective population size and migration. We consider the effects of geographic structure on variation within and between local populations, first in general terms, and then for specific migration models. We discuss the close parallels between geographic structure and stable types of genetic structure caused by selection, including balancing selection and background selection. The effects of departures from stability, such as selective sweeps and population bottlenecks, are also described. Methods for distinguishing population history from the effects of ongoing gene flow are discussed. We relate the theoretical results to observed patterns of variation in natural populations. },

@article{barton1983multilocus,
  abstract = {When two populations which differ at many loci meet, the degree of introgression of alleles across the boundary will depend on the selection acting on each locus (s), the rate of recombination between adjacent loci (r), and the number of loci involved (n). Simple scaling arguments suggest that the behavior of the system should depend on the ratio of selection to recombination (θ = s/r), and on n. This is borne out by mathematical analysis of two demes which exchange individuals at a low rate; when selection is stronger than recombination (θ > 1), the effective selection on each locus is comparable to the total selection over the whole genome (s* ∼ ns). When selection is weaker than recombination (θ < 1), the effective selection is much weaker, but is still stronger than the selection on each locus alone (s* \sim sn20 for small θ). When n is very large, these two regimes are separated by a sharp threshold at θ = 1. The results are extended to two taxa which meet in a continuous habitat; the effective selection pressure, which determines the width of the hybrid zone, behaves in the same way as for the simpler case above. Even when selection is weak compared to recombination, multilocus clines have a sharp step at their center, flanked by tails of introgression in which the alleles behave independently of each other. The set of clines acts as a barrier to gene flow, and it is shown that the barrier is strongest when selection is spread over many loci. The implications of the results for divergence and speciation are discussed.},

  abstract = {Why do species not adapt to ever-wider ranges of conditions, gradually expanding their ecological niche and geographic range? Gene flow across environments has two conflicting effects: although it increases genetic variation, which is a prerequisite for adaptation, gene flow may swamp adaptation to local conditions. In 1956, Haldane proposed that, when the environment varies across space, “swamping” by gene flow creates a positive feedback between low population size and maladaptation, leading to a sharp range margin. However, current deterministic theory shows that, when variance can evolve, there is no such limit. Using simple analytical tools and simulations, we show that genetic drift can generate a sharp margin to a species’ range, by reducing genetic variance below the level needed for adaptation to spatially variable conditions. Aided by separation of ecological and evolutionary timescales, the identified effective dimensionless parameters reveal a simple threshold that predicts when adaptation at the range margin fails. Two observable parameters determine the threshold: (i) the effective environmental gradient, which can be measured by the loss of fitness due to dispersal to a different environment; and (ii) the efficacy of selection relative to genetic drift. The theory predicts sharp range margins even in the absence of abrupt changes in the environment. Furthermore, it implies that gradual worsening of conditions across a species’ habitat may lead to a sudden range fragmentation, when adaptation to a wide span of conditions within a single species becomes impossible.},

  abstract = {This paper derives the long-term effective size, Ne, for a general model of population subdivision, allowing for differential deme fitness, variable emigration and immigration rates, extinction, colonization, and correlations across generations in these processes. We show that various long-term measures of Ne are equivalent. The effective size of a metapopulation can be expressed in a variety of ways. At a demographic equilibrium, Ne can be derived from the demography by combining information about the ultimate contribution of each deme to the future genetic make-up of the population and Wright's FST's. The effective size is given by Ne = 1/(1 + var (upsilon) ((1 - FST)/Nin), where n is the number of demes, theta i is the eventual contribution of individuals in deme i to the whole population (scaled such that sigma theta i = n), and  denotes an average weighted by theta i. This formula is applied to a catastrophic extinction model (where sites are either empty or at carrying capacity) and to a metapopulation model with explicit dynamics, where extinction is caused by demographic stochasticity and by chaos. Contrary to the expectation from the standard island model, the usual effect of population subdivision is to decrease the effective size relative to a panmictic population living on the same resource.},

  abstract = {Crosses between closely related species give two contrasting results. One result is that species hybrids may be inferior to their parents, for example, being less fertile [1]. The other is that F1 hybrids may display superior performance (heterosis), for example with increased vigour [2]. Although various hypotheses have been proposed to account for these two aspects of hybridisation, their biological basis is still poorly understood [3]. To gain further insights into this issue, we analysed the role that variation in gene expression may play. We took a conserved trait, flower asymmetry in Antirrhinum, and determined the extent to which the underlying regulatory genes varied in expression among closely related species. We show that expression of both genes analysed, CYC and RAD, varies significantly between species because of cis-acting differences. By making a quantitative genotype-phenotype map, using a range of mutant alleles, we demonstrate that the species lie on a plateau in gene expression-morphology space, so that the variation has no detectable phenotypic effect. However, phenotypic differences can be revealed by shifting genotypes off the plateau through genetic crosses. Our results can be readily explained if genomes are free to evolve within an effectively neutral zone in gene expression space. The consequences of this drift will be negligible for individual loci, but when multiple loci across the genome are considered, we show that the variation may have significant effects on phenotype and fitness, causing a significant drift load. By considering these consequences for various gene-expression-fitness landscapes, we conclude that F1 hybrids might be expected to show increased performance with regard to conserved traits, such as basic physiology, but reduced performance with regard to others. Thus, our study provides a new way of explaining how various aspects of hybrid performance may arise through natural variation in gene activity.},

What kind of QTL do we expect to find and what can our observations of QTL tell us about how organisms evolve?

@article{barton1999clines,
  abstract = {This article outlines theoretical models of clines in additive polygenic traits, which are maintained by stabilizing selection towards a spatially varying optimum. Clines in the trait mean can be accurately predicted, given knowledge of the genetic variance. However, predicting the variance is difficult, because it depends on genetic details. Changes in genetic variance arise from changes in allele frequency, and in linkage disequilibria. Allele frequency changes dominate when selection is weak relative to recombination, and when there are a moderate number of loci. With a continuum of alleles, gene flow inflates the genetic variance in the same way as a source of mutations of small effect. The variance can be approximated by assuming a Gaussian distribution of allelic effects; with a sufficiently steep cline, this is accurate even when mutation and selection alone are better described by the 'House of Cards' approximation. With just two alleles at each locus, the phenotype changes in a similar way: the mean remains close to the optimum, while the variance changes more slowly, and over a wider region. However, there may be substantial cryptic divergence at the underlying loci. With strong selection and many loci, linkage disequilibria are the main cause of changes in genetic variance. Even for strong selection, the infinitesimal model can be closely approximated by assuming a Gaussian distribution of breeding values. Linkage disequilibria can generate a substantial increase in genetic variance, which is concentrated at sharp gradients in trait means.},

@article{hearn2014likelihoodbased,
  abstract = { Short-read sequencing technologies have in principle made it feasible to draw detailed inferences about the recent history of any organism. In practice, however, this remains challenging due to the difficulty of genome assembly in most organisms and the lack of statistical methods powerful enough to discriminate between recent, nonequilibrium histories. We address both the assembly and inference challenges. We develop a bioinformatic pipeline for generating outgroup-rooted alignments of orthologous sequence blocks from de novo low-coverage short-read data for a small number of genomes, and show how such sequence blocks can be used to fit explicit models of population divergence and admixture in a likelihood framework. To illustrate our approach, we reconstruct the Pleistocene history of an oak-feeding insect (the oak gallwasp Biorhiza pallida), which, in common with many other taxa, was restricted during Pleistocene ice ages to a longitudinal series of southern refugia spanning the Western Palaearctic. Our analysis of sequence blocks sampled from a single genome from each of three major glacial refugia reveals support for an unexpected history dominated by recent admixture. Despite the fact that 80\% of the genome is affected by admixture during the last glacial cycle, we are able to infer the deeper divergence history of these populations. These inferences are robust to variation in block length, mutation model and the sampling location of individual genomes within refugia. This combination of de novo assembly and numerical likelihood calculation provides a powerful framework for estimating recent population history that can be applied to any organism without the need for prior genetic resources.},

We define and calculate measures of the barrier to gene flow between two distinct demes, and across a continuous habitat. In both cases, we find that in order for gene flow to be significantly reduced over much of the genome, hybrids must be substantially less fit, and the number of genes involved in building the barrier must be so large that the majority of other genes become closely linked to some locus which is under selection.

@article{barton2013inference,
  abstract = {Abstract
We outline two approaches to inference of neighbourhood size, N , and dispersal rate, σ 2 , based on either allele frequencies or on the lengths of sequence blocks that are shared between genomes. Over intermediate timescales (10–100 generations, say), populations that live in two dimensions approach a quasi-equilibrium that is independent of both their local structure and their deeper history. Over such scales, the standardised covariance of allele frequencies (i.e. pairwise F S T ) falls with the logarithm of distance, and depends only on neighbourhood size, N , and a ‘local scale’, κ ; the rate of gene flow, σ 2 , cannot be inferred. We show how spatial correlations can be accounted for, assuming a Gaussian distribution of allele frequencies, giving maximum likelihood estimates of N and κ . Alternatively, inferences can be based on the distribution of the lengths of sequence that are identical between blocks of genomes: long blocks (&gt;0.1 cm, say) tell us about intermediate timescales, over which we assume a quasi-equilibrium. For large neighbourhood size, the distribution of long blocks is given directly by the classical Wright–Malécot formula; this relationship can be used to infer both N and σ 2 . With small neighbourhood size, there is an appreciable chance that recombinant lineages will coalesce back before escaping into the distant past. For this case, we show that if genomes are sampled from some distance apart, then the distribution of lengths of blocks that are identical in state is geometric, with a mean that depends on N and σ 2 .},

@article{barton2013genetic,
  abstract = {When a mutation with selective advantage s spreads through a panmictic population, it may cause two lineages at a linked locus to coalesce; the probability of coalescence is exp ( − 2 r T ) , where T ∼ log ( 2 N s ) / s is the time to fixation, N is the number of haploid individuals, and r is the recombination rate. Population structure delays fixation, and so weakens the effect of a selective sweep. However, favourable alleles spread through a spatially continuous population behind a narrow wavefront; ancestral lineages are confined at the tip of this front, and so coalesce rapidly. In extremely dense populations, coalescence is dominated by rare fluctuations ahead of the front. However, we show that for moderate densities, a simple quasi-deterministic approximation applies: the rate of coalescence within the front is λ ∼ 2 g ( η ) / ( ρ ℓ ) , where ρ is the population density and ℓ = σ 2 / s is the characteristic scale of the wavefront; g ( η ) depends only on the strength of random drift, η = ρ σ s / 2 . The net effect of a sweep on coalescence also depends crucially on whether two lineages are ever both within the wavefront at the same time: even in the extreme case when coalescence within the front is instantaneous, the net rate of coalescence may be lower than in a single panmictic population. Sweeps can also have a substantial impact on the rate of gene flow. A single lineage will jump to a new location when it is hit by a sweep, with mean square displacement σ eff 2 / σ 2 = ( 8 / 3 ) ( L / ℓ ) ( Λ / R ) ; this can be substantial if the species’ range, L , is large, even if the species-wide rate of sweeps per map length, Λ / R , is small. This effect is half as strong in two dimensions. In contrast, the rate of coalescence between lineages, at random locations in space and on the genetic map, is proportional to ( c / L ) ( Λ / R ) , where c is the wavespeed: thus, on average, one-dimensional structure is likely to reduce coalescence due to sweeps, relative to panmixis. In two dimensions, genes must move along the front before they can coalesce; this process is rapid, being dominated by rare fluctuations. This leads to a dramatically higher rate of coalescence within the wavefront than if lineages simply diffused along the front. Nevertheless, the net rate of coalescence due to a sweep through a two-dimensional population is likely to be lower than it would be with panmixis.},

  abstract = {The maintenance of polygenic variation through a balance between mutation and stabilizing
selection can be approximated in two ways. In the ' Gaussian' approximation, a normal distribution
of allelic effects is assumed at each locus. In the 'House of Cards' approximation, the effect of new

approximations were developed to describe models where alleles may have a continuous range of
effects. However, previous analyses of models with only two alleles have predicted an equilibrium
variance equal to that given by the 'House of Cards' approximation. These analyses of biallelic
models have assumed that, at equilibrium, the population mean is at the optimum. Here, it is
shown that many stable equilibria may coexist, each giving a slight deviation from the optimum.
Though the variance is given by the ' House of Cards' approximation when the mean is at the
optimum, it increases towards a value of the same order as that given by the 'Gaussian'
approximation when the mean deviates from the optimum. Thus, the equilibrium variance cannot
be predicted by any simple model, but depends on the previous history of the population.

  abstract = {Random genetic drift shifts clines in space, alters their width, and distorts their shape. Such random fluctuations complicate inferences from cline width and position. Notably, the effect of genetic drift on the expected shape of the cline is opposite to the naive (but quite common) misinterpretation of classic results on the expected cline. While random drift on average broadens the overall cline in expected allele frequency, it narrows the width of any particular cline. The opposing effects arise because locally, drift drives alleles to fixation—but fluctuations in position widen the expected cline. The effect of genetic drift can be predicted from standardized variance in allele frequencies, averaged across the habitat: 〈F〉. A cline maintained by spatially varying selection (step change) is expected to be narrower by a factor of  relative to the cline in the absence of drift. The expected cline is broader by the inverse of this factor. In a tension zone maintained by underdominance, the expected cline width is narrower by about 1 – 〈F〉 relative to the width in the absence of drift. Individual clines can differ substantially from the expectation, and we give quantitative predictions for the variance in cline position and width. The predictions apply to clines in almost one-dimensional circumstances such as hybrid zones in rivers, deep valleys, or along a coast line and give a guide to what patterns to expect in two dimensions.},

@article{barton2009statisticalphysics,
  abstract = {There is a close analogy between statistical thermodynamics and the evolution of allele frequencies under mutation, selection and random drift. Wright's formula for the stationary distribution of allele frequencies is analogous to the Boltzmann distribution in statistical physics. Population size, 2N, plays the role of the inverse temperature, 1/kT, and determines the magnitude of random fluctuations. Log mean fitness, log(W), tends to increase under selection, and is analogous to a (negative) energy; a potential function, U, increases under mutation in a similar way. An entropy, S(H), can be defined which measures the deviation from the distribution of allele frequencies expected under random drift alone; the sum G=E[log(W)+U+S(H)] gives a free fitness that increases as the population evolves towards its stationary distribution. Usually, we observe the distribution of a few quantitative traits that depend on the frequencies of very many alleles. The mean and variance of such traits are analogous to observable quantities in statistical thermodynamics. Thus, we can define an entropy, S(Omega), which measures the volume of allele frequency space that is consistent with the observed trait distribution. The stationary distribution of the traits is exp[2N(log(W)+U+S(Omega))]; this applies with arbitrary epistasis and dominance. The entropies S(Omega), S(H) are distinct, but converge when there are so many alleles that traits fluctuate close to their expectations. Populations tend to evolve towards states that can be realised in many ways (i.e., large S(Omega)), which may lead to a substantial drop below the adaptive peak; we illustrate this point with a simple model of genetic redundancy. This analogy with statistical thermodynamics brings together previous ideas in a general framework, and justifies a maximum entropy approximation to the dynamics of quantitative traits.},

  abstract = {In a diploid population with two alleles $(\text a,\text A)$ at a single locus it is assumed that there are initially only AA or aA individuals; the focus of the paper is the time to first appearance of aa individuals. All states with any aa are treated as an absorbing state and a limiting process constructed which is a diffusion with killing or loss to the absorbing state. The infinitesimal generator of the diffusion is $Lu={\textstyle\frac 1{2}}(xu''+\nu u'-x^2u)$, where $x$ is nonnegative and $\nu$ is a parameter which determines the mutation rate from A to a. The cases $0<\nu<1$ and $\nu\geq 1$ give a regular or entrance boundary at $x=0$, respectively. For large mutation rates $(\nu\geq 1)$, the mean killing time is found exactly when the initial number of aA is small. The cumulative number of aA before the appearance of any aa and the probability that the diffusion is killed in a given set are calculated. Numerical values of the expected population at which detection of aa occurs are found for various $\nu$. For small mutation rates $(0<\nu<1)$, a reflecting boundary condition is imposed at the origin. For $0<\nu<1$, quasifixation probabilities are determined and employed to find expressions for the probability of detection as a function of population size and the initial number of heterozygotes.

In the corrigenda a misprint in a formula for the mean time to appearance of a recessive homozygote in a diploid population (two alleles, single locus) is corrected. },

  abstract = {We investigate a new model for populations evolving in a spatial continuum. This model can be thought of as a spatial version of the Lambda-Fleming-Viot process. It explicitly incorporates both small scale reproduction events and large scale extinction-recolonisation events. The lineages ancestral to a sample from a population evolving according to this model can be described in terms of a spatial version of the Lambda-coalescent. Using a technique of Evans (1997), we prove existence and uniqueness in law for the model. We then investigate the asymptotic behaviour of the genealogy of a finite number of individuals sampled uniformly at random (or more generally `far enough apart') from a two-dimensional torus of sidelength L as L tends to infinity. Under appropriate conditions (and on a suitable timescale) we can obtain as limiting genealogical processes a Kingman coalescent, a more general Lambda-coalescent or a system of coalescing Brownian motions (with a non-local coalescence mechanism).

  abstract = { Classical models of gene flow fail in three ways: they cannot explain large-scale patterns; they predict much more genetic diversity than is observed; and they assume that loosely linked genetic loci evolve independently. We propose a new model that deals with these problems. Extinction events kill some fraction of individuals in a region. These are replaced by offspring from a small number of parents, drawn from the preexisting population. This model of evolution forwards in time corresponds to a backwards model, in which ancestral lineages jump to a new location if they are hit by an event, and may coalesce with other lineages that are hit by the same event. We derive an expression for the identity in allelic state, and show that, over scales much larger than the largest event, this converges to the classical value derived by Wright and Malécot. However, rare events that cover large areas cause low genetic diversity, large-scale patterns, and correlations in ancestry between unlinked loci.

However, this behavior does not extend to a large array of demes. Then, the fixation probability depends primarily on neighborhood size (Nb), and may be appreciable even with strong selection and free gene flow (≈exp(-B·Nb $\sqrt{s}$ ) in one dimension, ≈exp(-B\cdotNb) in two dimensions).

@article{barton2000hitchhiking,
  abstract = {Selection on one or more genes inevitably perturbs other genes, even when those genes have no direct effect on fitness. This article reviews the theory of such genetic hitchhiking, concentrating on effects on neutral loci. Maynard Smith and Haigh introduced the classical case where the perturbation is due to a single favourable mutation. This is contrasted with the apparently distinct effects of inherited variation in fitness due to loosely linked loci. A model of fluctuating selection is analysed which bridges these alternative treatments. When alleles sweep between extreme frequencies at a rate lambda, the rate of drift is increased by a factor (1 + E[1/pq]lambda/(2(2lambda + r))), where the recombination rate r is much smaller than the strength of selection. In spatially structured populations, the effects of any one substitution are weaker, and only cause a local increase in the frequency of a neutral allele. This increase depends primarily on the rate of recombination relative to selection (r/s), and more weakly, on the neighbourhood size, Nb = 4(pi rho sigma)2. Spatial subdivision may allow local selective sweeps to occur more frequently than is indicated by the overall rate of molecular evolution. However, it seems unlikely that such sweeps can be sufficiently frequent to increase significantly the drift of neutral alleles.},

@article{barton1998effect,
  abstract = { ABSTRACT When a favourable mutation sweeps to fixation, those genes initially linked to it increase in frequency; on average, this reduces diversity in the surrounding region of the genome. In the first analysis of this 'hitch-hiking' effect, Maynard-Smith and Haigh (1974) followed the increase of the neutral allele that chanced to be associated with the new mutation in the first generation, and assumed that the subsequent increase was deterministic. Later analyses, based on either coalescence arguments, or on diffusion equations for the mean and variance of allele frequency, have also made one or both of these assumptions. In the early generations, stochastic fluctuations in the frequency of the selected allele, and coalescence of neutral lineages, can be accounted for correctly by following relationships between genes conditional on the number of copies of the favourable allele. This analysis shows that the hitch-hiking effect is increased because an allele that is destined to fix tends to increase more rapidly than exponentially. However, the identity generated by the selective sweep has the same form as in previous work, h[r/s] (2 Ns)^(-2r/s), where h[r/s] tends to 1 with tight linkage. This analysis is extended to samples of many genes; then, genes may trace back to several families of lineages, each related through a common ancestor early in the selective sweep. Simulations show that the number and sizes of these families can (in principle) be used to make separate estimates of r/s and Ns. },

@article{barton2004effect,
  abstract = {The coalescent process can describe the effects of selection at linked loci only if selection is so strong that genotype frequencies evolve deterministically. Here, we develop methods proposed by Kaplan, Darden, and Hudson to find the effects of weak selection. We show that the overall effect is given by an extension to Price's equation: the change in properties such as moments of coalescence times is equal to the covariance between those properties and the fitness of the sample of genes. The distribution of coalescence times differs substantially between allelic classes, even in the absence of selection. However, the average coalescence time between randomly chosen genes is insensitive to the current allele frequency and is affected significantly by purifying selection only if deleterious mutations are common and selection is strong (i.e., the product of population size and selection coefficient, Ns > 3). Balancing selection increases mean coalescence times, but the effect becomes large only when mutation rates between allelic classes are low and when selection is extremely strong. Our analysis supports previous simulations that show that selection has surprisingly little effect on genealogies. Moreover, small fluctuations in allele frequency due to random drift can greatly reduce any such effects. This will make it difficult to detect the action of selection from neutral variation alone.

  abstract = {

We consider a single genetic locus which carries two alleles, labelled P and Q. This locus experiences selection and mutation. It is linked to a second neutral locus with recombination rate r. If r=0, this reduces to the study of a single selected locus. Assuming a Moran model for the population dynamics, we pass to a diffusion approximation and, assuming that the allele frequencies at the selected locus have reached stationarity, establish the joint generating function for the genealogy of a sample from the population and the frequency of the P allele. In essence this is the joint generating function for a coalescent and the random background in which it evolves. We use this to characterize, for the diffusion approximation, the probability of identity in state at the neutral locus of a sample of two individuals (whose type at the selected locus is known) as solutions to a system of ordinary differential equations. The only subtlety is to find the boundary conditions for this system. Finally, numerical examples are presented that illustrate the accuracy and predictions of the diffusion approximation. In particular, a comparison is made between this approach and one in which the frequencies at the selected locus are estimated by their value in the absence of fluctuations and a classical structured coalescent model is used.

  abstract = {A local barrier to gene flow will delay the spread of an advantageous allele. Exact calculations for the deterministic case show that an allele that is favorable when rare is delayed very little even by a strong barrier: its spread is slowed by a time proportional to log((B/sigma) square root of 2S)/S, where B is the barrier strength, sigma the dispersal range, and fitnesses are 1:1 + S:1 + 2S. However, when there is selection against heterozygotes, such that the allele cannot increase from low frequency, a barrier can cause a much greater delay. If gene flow is reduced below a critical value, spread is entirely prevented. Stochastic simulations show that with additive selection, random drift slows down the spread of the allele, below the deterministic speed of sigma square root of 2S. The delay to the advance of an advantageous allele caused by a strong barrier can be substantially increased by random drift and increases with B/(2S rho sigma 2) in a one-dimensional habitat of density rho. However, with selection against heterozygotes, drift can facilitate the spread and can free an allele that would otherwise be trapped indefinitely by a strong barrier. We discuss the implications of these results for the evolution of chromosome rearrangements.},

  abstract = {Any sample of genes traces back to a single common ancestor. Each gene also has other properties: its sequence, its geographic location and the phenotype and fitness of the organism that carries it. With sexual reproduction, different genes have different gencalogies, which gives us much more information, but also greatly complicates population genetic analysis. We review the close relation between the distribution of genealogies and the classic theory of identity by descent in spatially structured populations, and develop a simple diffusion approximation to the distribution of coalescence times in a homogeneous two-dimensional habitat. This shows that when neighbourhood size is large (as in most populations) only a small fraction of pairs of genes are closely related, and only this fraction gives information about current rates of gene flow. The increase of spatial dispersion with lineage age is thus a poor estimator of gene flow. The bulk of the genealogy depends on the long-term history of the population; we discuss ways of inferring this history from the concordance between genealogies across loci.

@article{barton-szyura,
  abstract = {The fire-bellied toads Bombina bombina and B. variegata differ extensively in biochemistry, morphology, and behavior. We use a survey of five diagnostic enzyme loci across the hybrid zone near Cracow in Southern Poland to estimate the dispersal rate, selection pressures, and numbers of loci which maintain this zone. The enzyme clines coincide closely with each other and with morphological and mitochondrial DNA clines. Although the zone lies on a broad transition between environments suitable for bombina and variegata, the close concordance of diverse characters, together with increased aberrations and mortality in hybrids, suggest that the zone is maintained largely by selection against hybrids. There are strong "linkage disequilibria" between each pair of (unlinked) enzyme loci (R̄ = 0.129 [2-unit support limits: 0.119-0.139]). These are probably caused by gene flow into the zone, and they give an estimate of dispersal (σ = 890 [790-940] m gen-1/2). The clines are sharply stepped, with most of the change occurring within 6.15 (5.45-6.45) km, but with long tails of introgression on either side. This implies that the effective selection pressure on each enzyme marker (due largely to disequilibrium with other loci) is s* = 0.17 (0.159-0.181) at the center but that the selection acting directly on the enzyme loci is weak or zero (se < 0.0038). The stepped pattern implies a barrier to gene flow of 220 (48-415) km. This would substantially delay neutral introgression but would have little effect on advantageous alleles; the two taxa need not evolve independently. Strong selection is needed to maintain such a barrier: hybrid populations must have their mean fitness reduced by a factor of 0.65 (0.60-0.77). This selection must be spread over a large number of loci to account for the concordant patterns and the observed cline widths (N = 300 [80-2,000]).},

@article{surviving-blocks,
  abstract = {What is the chance that some part of a stretch of genome will survive? In a population of constant size, and with no selection, the probability of survival of some part of a stretch of map length y < 1 approaches y / log(yt/2) for logyt >> 1. Thus, the whole genome is certain to be lost, but the rate of loss is extremely slow. This solution extends to give the whole distribution of surviving block sizes as a function of time. We show that the expected number of blocks at time t is 1+yt and give expressions for the moments of the number of blocks and the total amount of genome that survives for a given time. The solution is based on a branching process and assumes complete interference between crossovers, so that each descendant carries only a single block of ancestral material. We consider cases where most individuals carry multiple blocks, either because there are multiple crossovers in a long genetic map, or because enough time has passed that most individuals in the population are related to each other. For species such as ours, which have a long genetic map, the genome of any individual which leaves descendants approximately 80\% of the population for a Poisson offspring number with mean two is likely to persist for an extremely long time, in the form of a few short blocks of genome.},

@article{J.Mallet04011990,
  abstract = {Hybrid zones can yield estimates of natural selection and gene flow. The width of a cline in gene frequency is approximately proportional to gene flow ({sigma}) divided by the square root of per-locus selection ({complex}s). Gene flow also causes gametic correlations (linkage disequilibria) between genes that differ across hybrid zones. Correlations are stronger when the hybrid zone is narrow, and rise to a maximum roughly equal to s. Thus cline width and gametic correlations combine to give estimates of gene flow and selection. These indirect measures of {sigma} and s are especially useful because they can be made from collections, and require no field experiments. The method was applied to hybrid zones between color pattern races in a pair of Peruvian Heliconius butterfly species. The species are Mullerian mimics of one another, and both show the same changes in warning color pattern across their respective hybrid zones. The expectations of cline width and gametic correlation were generated using simulations of clines stabilized by strong frequency-dependent selection. In the hybrid zone in Heliconius erato, clines at three major color pattern loci were between 8.5 and 10.2 km wide, and the pairwise gametic correlations peaked at R {complex} 0.35. These measures suggest that s {complex} 0.23 per locus, and that {sigma} {complex} 2.6 km. In erato, the shapes of the clines agreed with that expected on the basis of dominance. Heliconius melpomene has a nearly coincident hybrid zone. In this species, cline widths at four major color pattern loci varied between 11.7 and 13.4 km. Pairwise gametic correlations peaked near R {complex} 1.00 for tightly linked genes, and at R {complex} 0.40 for unlinked genes, giving s {complex} 0.25 per locus and {sigma} {complex} 3.7 km. In melpomene, cline shapes did not perfectly fit theoretical shapes based on dominance; this deviation might be explained by long-distance migration and/or strong epistasis. Compared with erato, sample sizes in melpomene are lower and the genetics of its color patterns are less well understood. In spite of these problems, selection and gene flow are clearly of the same order of magnitude in the two species. The relatively high per locus selection coefficients agree with ``major gene'' theories for the evolution of Mullerian mimicry, but the genetic architecture of the color patterns does not. These results show that the genetics and evolution of mimicry are still only sketchily understood.

It is shown that a linked cline induces a step in the frequency of a neutral allele, which is proportional to the gradient in neutral allele frequency and to the inverse of the recombination rate. A barrier to dispersal or a local region of low abundance has a similar effect (Nagylaki, 1976). The cline will block the flow of neutral alleles over a region of chromosome roughly 2 sqrt s/t map units long. However, a slightly advantageous allele will be little affected, and must be very tightly linked to be delayed for long.},

  abstract = {We introduce a general recursion for the probability of identity in state of two individuals sampled from a population subject to mutation, migration, and random drift in a two-dimensional continuum. The recursion allows for the interactions induced by density-dependent regulation of the population, which are inevitable in a continuous population. We give explicit series expansions for large neighbourhood size and for low mutation rates respectively and investigate the accuracy of the classical Malécot formula for these general models. When neighbourhood size is small, this formula does not give the identity even over large scales. However, for large neighbourhood size, it is an accurate approximation which summarises the local population structure in terms of three quantities: the effective dispersal rate, σe; the effective population density, ρe; and a local scale, κ, at which local interactions become significant. The results are illustrated by simulations.

@article{barton1979dynamics,
  abstract = {This paper investigates the dynamic behaviour of hybrid zones which are maintained by a balance between dispersal and selection against hybrids. In the first section it is shown that a hybrid zone involving a single locus can move in response to a selective imbalance between the two homozygotes, and also to variation in population density and dispersal rate. It can be trapped by natural barriers, and so an allele which is selected against when rare cannot advance, even if it is advantageous when common. The continuous model used in deriving these results is shown to be a good approximation to the stepping-stone model, provided that the cline contains several demes.

The effect of stochastic forces on multi-locus hybrid zones is then considered. An expression giving the shift in position after an arbitrary perturbation in gamete frequency is derived. Using this formula, it is found that sampling drift is negligible unless the zone includes few organisms and involves few loci. Random variations in population structure are the dominant force, and could allow considerable movement in an even environment. However, natural barriers can still trap hybrid zones, and so it is likely that they will remain roughly where they first formed.},

Then, the flow of alleles at a neutral marker locus which is linked to these selected loci will be impeded. We define and calculate measures of the barrier to gene flow between two distinct demes, and across a continuous habitat. In both cases, we find that in order for gene flow to be significantly reduced over much of the genome, hybrids must be substantially less fit, and the number of genes involved in building the barrier must be so large that the majority of other genes become closely linked to some locus which is under selection. This conclusion is not greatly affected by the pattern of epistasis, or the position of the marker locus along the chromosome.},

This progress has been driven largely by empirical results, and most useful theoretical work has concentrated on making sense of empirical patterns. Given the complexity of speciation, mathematical theory is subordinate to verbal theory and generalizations about data. Nevertheless, mathematical theory can provide a useful classification of verbal theories; can help determine the biological plausibility of verbal theories; can determine whether alternative mechanisms of speciation are consistent with empirical patterns; and can occasionally provide predictions that go beyond empirical generalizations.

@article{barton2001hybridization,
  abstract = {Hybridization may influence evolution in a variety of ways. If hybrids are less fit, the geo-
graphical range of ecologically divergent populations may be limited, and prezygotic
reproductive isolation may be reinforced. If some hybrid genotypes are fitter than one or
both parents, at least in some environments, then hybridization could make a positive con-
tribution. Single alleles that are at an advantage in the alternative environment and genetic
background will introgress readily, although such introgression may be hard to detect.
‘Hybrid speciation’, in which fit combinations of alleles are established, is more problematic;
its likelihood depends on how divergent populations meet, and on the structure of epistasis.
These issues are illustrated using Fisher’s model of stabilizing selection on multiple traits,
under which reproductive isolation evolves as a side-effect of adaptation in allopatry. This
confirms a priori arguments that while recombinant hybrids are less fit on average, some
gene combinations may be fitter than the parents, even in the parental environment.
Fisher’s model does predict heterosis in diploid F 1 s, asymmetric incompatibility in reciprocal
backcrosses, and (when dominance is included) Haldane’s Rule. However, heterosis arises
only when traits are additive, whereas the latter two patterns require dominance. Moreover,
because adaptation is via substitutions of small effect, Fisher’s model does not generate the
strong effects of single chromosome regions often observed in species crosses.},
